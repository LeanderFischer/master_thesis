The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2–4%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented."

abstract = "Weak and electromagnetic interactions of the leptons are examined under the hypothesis that the weak interactions are mediated by vector bosons. With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries. Such symmetries may be established if additional vector bosons or additional leptons are introduced. Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon). Corresponding partially-conserved quantities suggest leptonic analogues to the conserved quantities associated with strong interactions: strangeness and isobaric spin."

We discuss the differences arising between the consistent combination of the data samples from accelerator and reactor experiments compared to partial combinations. We quantify the confidence in the determination of the less precisely known parameters $\theta$23, $\delta$CP, and the neutrino mass ordering by performing a Monte Carlo study of the long baseline accelerator and reactor data. We find that the sensitivity to the mass ordering and the $\theta$23 octant is below 1$\sigma$. Maximal $\theta$23 mixing is allowed at slightly more than 90{\%} CL. The best fit for the CP violating phase is around 270{\textdegree}, CP conservation is allowed at slightly above 1$\sigma$, and values of $\delta$CP ≃ 90{\textdegree} are disfavored at around 99{\%} CL for normal ordering and higher CL for inverted ordering.",

We provide the allowed ranges of the six oscillation parameters and show that their determination is stable with respect to uncertainties related to reactor neutrino and solar neutrino flux predictions. We find that the maximal possible value of the Jarlskog invariant in the lepton sector is 0.033 {\textpm}0.010 ({\textpm}0.027) at the 1$\sigma$ (3$\sigma$) level and we use leptonic unitarity triangles to illustrate the ability of global oscillation data to obtain information on CP violation. We discuss ``tendencies and tensions'' of the global fit related to the octant of $\theta$23 as well as the CP violating phase $\delta$CP. The favored values of $\delta$CP are around 3$\pi$/2 while values around $\pi$/2 are disfavored at about $\Delta$$\chi$2 ≃6.

abstract = "The present article is a review of phenomena connected with neutrino oscillations. Mixing of two neutrinos (Majorana as well as Dirac) with masses m1 and m2 is considered in detail. It is shown that the hypothesis of lepton mixing is not in contradiction with the existing data if |m12−m22| ⪅ 1 (eV)2. Possible experiments designed to reveal neutrino oscillations at reactor, meson factory and high energy accelerator facilities are considered. In such experiments oscillation might be found if |m12−m22| ⪆ 0.01 (eV)2. The possibilities of searching for oscillations by experiments on cosmic ray neutrinos and especially on solar neutrinos are discussed in detail. The last experiments have an incredible high sensitivity from the point of view of testing the lepton mixing hypothesis (oscillation effects might be observable if |m12−m22| ⪆ 10−12 (eV)2). The “solar neutrino puzzle” is also discussed from the point of view of lepton mixing. Neutrino oscillations are considered then in the case where in nature there exist N ⩾ 2 neutrino types. In conclusion the case of heavy lepton mixing is considered. It is shown that in a concrete scheme with right-handed currents, the probabilities of such processes as μ → eγ, μ → 3e etc. can be close to existing experimental upper limits, provided the heavy lepton masses are of an order of a few GeV, whereas the probabilities of the above processes are entirely negligible if only neutrinos are mixed."

abstract = "The mean stopping power for high-energy muons in matter can be described by 〈−dE/dx〉=a(E)+b(E)E, where a(E) is the electronic stopping power and b(E) is the energy-scaled contribution from radiative processes—bremsstrahlung, pair production, and photonuclear interactions. a(E) and b(E) are both slowly varying functions of the muon energy E where radiative effects are important. Tables of these stopping power contributions and continuous-slowing-down-approximation ranges (which neglect multiple scattering and range straggling) are given for a selection of elements, compounds, mixtures, and biological materials for incident kinetic energies in the range of 10 MeV to 100 TeV. Tables of the contributions to b(E) are given for the same materials."
