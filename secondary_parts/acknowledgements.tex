I would also like to express my gratitude to Prof. Dr. Ulrich Uwer for offering to take responsibility for my work as my primary supervisor at Heidelberg University and for offering his time to examine it. 
I would like to thank Marek Kowalski for his support as a secondary supervisor and for making it possible for me to work on such an inspiring research topic as part of the IceCube group at DESY.

I am especially grateful to Summer Blot for the guidance in finding the topic of my thesis and for the strong support throughout the whole project.
Without her experience and her constant feedback the work contained in this thesis would not have been possible.

I would like to thank Jakob van Santen and Alexander Trettin for proof-reading parts of my thesis, and Summer Blot for reading the entire thesis and providing valuable feedback.

I would like to thank my family: my parents Christine and Wolfgang and my brother Simon for supporting me throughout writing this thesis and special thanks to my dad for proof-reading the final version of my thesis.
Last but not least i would like to thank Lotti for always being there for me.
